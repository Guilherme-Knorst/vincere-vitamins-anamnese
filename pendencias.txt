This was super helpful thank you so much these are the problems that I had that you guys can avoid
1.the less secure app is no longer available in Google account you should generate a password in google from the verification section in google account
2.there a setBody function in a section from your code is not declared so just delete it
3.you can skip the part when you show the data in components from dev tools because you need to add a react extension in order to have that option
4.make sure to add res.end(transporter.getVersionString()); in contact.js so you can give your client side a response
I hope this can help someone
Happy Coding :)
